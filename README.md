# Superstore-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-
I worked on a Superstore data analysis project to understand a common business blind spot:

Does high sales always translate to healthy profit?

Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that analyzes sales, profit, and order patterns across products and states to move beyond surface-level revenue numbers.

Key observations from the analysis:

Strong sales performance does not always align with profitability.
Certain products generate high order volumes but contribute weak or negative profit.
Profitability varies significantly across states, even when sales appear strong.
Focusing only on sales metrics can hide structural issues in pricing or cost strategy.

Why this matters:
 Without tracking profit alongside sales, businesses risk scaling revenue while quietly accumulating losses. This dashboard helps decision-makers identify where performance looks good on the surface but breaks down underneath.

Tools used:
 Tableau | Data Visualization | Business Analysis

This project reinforced an important lesson for me:
 👉 Sales show momentum. Profit shows sustainability.
